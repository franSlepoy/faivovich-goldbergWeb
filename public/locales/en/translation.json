Since 2014, the artists have carried out a sequence of immersions into the microscopic level of the Campo del Cielo meteorites. These images emerge as part of their research on microphotography, producing and examining thinly sliced sections, by exploring and harvesting the stunningly brilliant and mysterious silicate inclusions. Radiant iridescent flows of rock are overlapped, in abstract cosmic landscapes that glow with the potentiality of new matter. The artists’ decision to present the images in the round shape of the microscopic lens underscores their scientific origin.",

On their own, the micrographs provide few direct clues as to the context in which they were made and the archive in which they are held. Faivovich & Goldberg’s emphasize the diverse components of a seemingly unified rock, revealing that the meteorite consists of a variety of elements, each of a distinct shape, translucency and hue. Using tools designed for sophisticated analysis, they have instead put the object of study on hold and transformed it into a thing of beauty.",

    "bioTexto1": "Since 2006, Guillermo Faivovich and Nicolás Goldberg have been engaged in an intensive and wide-ranging research project—A Guide to Campo del Cielo—that forms the basis of their practice. Campo del Cielo is located in northern Argentina and was the site of a meteor shower about 4,000 years ago. Faivovich & Goldberg combine the roles of scientist, historian, anthropologist, and even bureaucrat, to conduct projects that suggest new ways of seeing and experiencing the terrestrial results of a long ago cosmic event, as well as thinking about its historical and cultural significance. For over a decade, the duo has produced a diverse body of work, laboriously mining the particularities of a singular event, Faivovich & Goldberg illuminate broadly resonant themes: the dynamics between an object and its documentation, the inherent complexities of institutional histories, and the complicated personal, cultural, and national relationships that develop with artifacts.",
    "bioTexto2": "Some of Faivovich & Goldberg’s latest projects are Encuentro con el El Mataco (Museo Histórico Provincial de Rosario Julio Marc, 2019), Mesón de Fierro: Towards the XXII Century (United Nations, Vienna, 2019), Auf der Suche nach Mesón de Fierro (Naturhistorisches Museum, Vienna, 2018), Decomiso (ASU Art Museum, Arizona, 2018), Un meteorito para la Sociedad Científica del año 2105 (U-Turn, arteBA, Buenos Aires, 2018), numero (11 Gwangju Biennal, South Korea, 2016), The San Juan Mass of Campo del Cielo en la Colección Guerrico (Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes)"
