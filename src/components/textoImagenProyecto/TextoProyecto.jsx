        Who owns the sky? Or for that matter,
anything that falls from the sky? Certain
indigenous groups such as the Australian
Aboriginal Warrabri believe that a meteorite
represents past, present and future realities,
which are at once parallel to our own. Fallen
matter has the power to compress time. The
work of Faivovich & Goldberg adresses how
artifacts are rooted in time and place, who gets
to place value on them and brings into
question the colonization of cultures and the
theft of cultural commodities that often end
up in the global markets.
Decomiso [2016] is centered around a
government seizure of meteorites in the
province of Santiago del Estero, Argentina.
The artists convinced state officials and were
granted access to index, classify and document
over 400 meteorites, which resulted in the
first enforcement of a neglected provincial law
used in the confiscation. According to the
official records made by the provinceâ€™s
notaries, they participate in the procedure not
as experts but as visual artists and researchers.
Focusing on the process of this event, the
artwork highlights the tedious process it took
to record this matter but also contemplates

the idea that so much of our human knowledge
is lost, buried, or neglected.
In an age marked by the invisibility of tax
havens and the hypervisibility offered by visual
havens like art, media, and social networks,
images of seizures move across the boundaries
drawn by this paradox. Art is not exempt from
these visual paradoxes in an age torn between
abstraction and matter, absolute intangibility
and a sense of total access, in which the image
of seizure stands as a frenzied hybrid, not just
because works of art are material protagonists
of organized crime and money laundering,
possessing vast warehouse space in tax havens,
but because they provide one of the greatest
reflections on seeing (and on how we see and
how far we see) in terms of current images and
their production, circulation, and
consumption. All artists are confiscators. They
reclaim materials from hazy sources: intuitive
creativity, data concealed from history,
unthinkable corners of science, or new takes
on politics.
